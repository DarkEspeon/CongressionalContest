	Crystal Collector is a single-player, two-dimensional, top-down video game created for the 2016 Congressional App Challenge. The app was built using the Java programming language and the Java standard class library. Crystal Collector uses user input from the keyboard’s arrow keys and/or the W, A, S, and D keys to move the in-game character. When the ESC key is pressed, the game is paused and a menu opens up. This menu has options to exit or resume the game. 
	Gameplay in Crystal Collector is simple. The object of the game is to collect the five ‘crystals’ scattered around the in-game world. To do this, the player must fight through hostile, randomly spawning, and AI-controlled ‘mobs.’ The user must click the mouse to attack a mob. After the player has completed this task, a single, much stronger enemy will spawn somewhere in the map. Once the player has defeated this enemy, they have won the game, but may continue exploring the world as they wish.
